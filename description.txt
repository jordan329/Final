This application is a c# frontend to a dotnet core backend that I wrote (which I will also include).
this application is for viewing information supplied by google maps about pizza places.

Simply type a zipcode into the textbox labeled "zip code" and press the "search zip" button,
and the application will make a get request to the API.

The API sends back JSON which is used to populate the "pizza place list" listbox.
Each item has a name and placeID property.

Once you click on an option more details are displayed based on a second get request sent
to the API which contains a placeID.
That placeID is then used to send back more JSON which gives more details
about the specific pizza place selected in the "pizza place list" listbox.

By clicking "Save Details" you can save the currently selected pizza places details in a .txt file.
